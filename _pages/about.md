I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Ananth Kalyanaraman](http://eecs.wsu.edu/~ananth/) and [Dr. Thomas Gilray](https://thomas.gilray.org/). My current research focus is on the parallelization of combinatorial graph algorithms, borrowing ideas from theoretical computer science and applied mathematics to engineer usable, high performance solutions for real-world problems. I am also interested in Algorithms with Predictions and the interpretability of Artifical Intelligence.

Previously, I was fortunate enough to have worked with [Dr. Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/) on block Krylov methods as a part of my master's thesis at New York University. Before NYU, I was a senior software engineer at Samsung Research Institute Bangalore and I studied computer Engineering at National Institute of Technology Karnataka. Outside of research, I am currently organizing a bi-weekly Computer Science Graduate Research seminar here at WSU.
